What I've done here is made it public. Anyone can make an account and use the functions that I've been using for a little while now. <br/><br/>

        The site features:<br/>
        A notepad block, for messages or reminders that you can take anywhere<br/>
        A shortcut system, where you can create links with custom icons (font awesome) and allows for expandable shortcuts<br/>
        A reminder system, add reminders with due dates, in specific categories<br/><br/>

        The site is still super in progress, and as I continue my education I hope to make it an app that is useful to everyone!
